# Survival Skills

The heat is extreme, but without humidity.  Japanese people will be accustomed to the heat.  

## Glamping is NOT camping

Glamping skills will not help one plan for daily life in the desert heat.  Please review the links related to packing lists.  

This group may decide to host some practice camping where people can test out their gear before the event.  Always a good idea to test everything.

---

# Packing list

- Minimal:  water, food, some clothes
- Camping: minimal, plus tent, tarp, spikes and tie downs, duct tape, usb power
- Prepper: tools, generator, plus camping

---

# Building A Camp

Best to share things with your friends vs 10 campers each bringing everything ... this is duplication of space and things needed.  

Common things to share: shade structures, generators, bulk water, bulk trash, tools, in some cases, a kitchen.
